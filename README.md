# 2023_KubSTU_EnrollementDemandHigherEducation

## Project overview

My client is a faculty of Russian university facing an issue with a descreasing demand for higher education for their faculty. The enrollment was dropping over last 2 years, so that even the scholarship funded educational spots were not filled out. The academia management is mostly concerned about the reasons for such a drop in the enrollement, and asked me to help them understand why the demand is descreasing and whether it will further descreasing.
